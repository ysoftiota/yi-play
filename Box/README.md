## Manufacturing procedure
1. Download [stl/obj files](https://github.com/ysoftiota/yi-play/blob/master/Box/IOTA_Play_Box_1.0.zip) or export them using FreeCAD from [model](https://github.com/ysoftiota/yi-play/blob/master/Box/IOTA_Play_Box_1.0.FCStd). Please note that FreeCAD version 0.16 or higher is required.
1. Select the models to print in DeeControl, layout is recommended the following:
![print](https://github.com/ysoftiota/yi-play/blob/master/Box/print.png)
1. You can print either on Normal (150um) or Draft mode (200um)
1. Make sure you have supports off and that all the settings on the advanced tab are reset to default
1. Always thoroughly clean the print bed (by water and dry it afterwards) so that the box surface is nice and shiny
1. Apply the glue in uniform thin layer over the whole surface of the print bed. Make sure there are no spots without the glue because the large surfaces have tendencies to pick up.
1. The print will take 3-4h depending on quality selected
1. After printing it is necessary to clean the buttons and button holes by a sharp knife so that the buttons move freely
1. If the buttons are not printed correctly, print them separately using slower speed
1. 4 screws are required. Screws from USBv2 (or longer from other products) are ideally suited.
1. Enjoy your IOTA Play in box
